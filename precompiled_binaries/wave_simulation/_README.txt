This demo is the current (January 28, 2014) build of DeferredShadingDemo

As this project is still in progress, if you want to most up-to-date version of the demo, download the full source and compile.

Overview:
This demo is something that happened between CubeDemo and LightingDemo. I wanted something interesting to look at when I did lighting. Using a wave simulation algorithm from  
"3D Game Programming with DirectX11", (which, admittably, I only have a vague understanding of how it works), I created this demo. In the end, it requires a dynamic vertex buffer,
which is not really ideal, so for the LightingDemo, I just used static geometry.

A possibility for the future is to let the GPU do all the simulation work.

Controls:
Hold left mouse and drag to rotate
Scroll middle mouse to zoom
